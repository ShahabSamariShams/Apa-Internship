Chapter 1:
Why? SQLi, Mass Assignment, and IDOR.
Why database? manageable, efficient storing, easier organize, access and analyze.
SQL? structured query lang. manage relational dbs. enables user interaction with db.(owasp related.)
NoSQL? not only sql. not relational, handles unstructured data.
query? how you talk to db.
root? a user that exists by default. has access to everything. other uers have limited access normally.
Structure? database -> table(e.g. users) -> column(e.g. users' attributes) -> data
Relational? IDs connecting e.g. user and book(s).

MySQL:
mysql-secure-installation
there exists some default dbs.
