Chapter 1:
Why network? internet's universality. Exploitation and discovery. security device bypassing. side recon conduction.
Bypass? circumventing security measures.
Exploit? taking advantage of vulnerabilities.
Protocol? rule set gor communication.
Client? a comp in network.
Server? serves data.
Internet? gigantic network of clients and servers.

OSI? Refernece model for dissimilar environments communication.
Layers?
Application*: SSH, HTTP, SMTP.
Presentation: Compression and encryption.(SSL)
Session: Connection managemnet without error.
Transport*: TCP and UDP.(assemler if number sequences.)
Network*: IP address, routing.
Data link: Mac/physical address.
Physical: Electrons.

IP? internet address for reaching a comp.
Port? various channels for communication.
Router? routes the traffic to a destination.
notation-> <IP>:<port>
Each port has a different service.

TCP: connection-oriented.(trustable)
UDP: connectionless.(eg dns.)

TCP flags: SYN(synchronization), ACK(acknowledgemnet)
TCP three way hand shake: syn, syn/ack, ack.

nc tool:
nc -lvp <portnumber> -> listen on the given port.
nc <ip> <port> -> connect to this ip address and port number over tcp.

wireshark tools:
ip.dst==<ip> -> filters packets with a particular dst.
follow <Protocol> stream -> observe the packets.
